# Contributing to IWE

Thank you for your interest in contributing to IWE! This document explains how to contribute effectively.

**Language:** Issues and PRs in English or Russian are both welcome.

## Ways to Contribute

### Report Issues

- **Bugs:** Something broke during `setup.sh`, `update.sh`, or a protocol didn't work as expected
- **Documentation:** Unclear instructions, broken links, missing explanations
- **Ideas:** Feature requests, workflow improvements, new use cases

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/FMT-exocortex-template/issues) with the appropriate template.

**Before filing a new issue:**

1. **Read the [Roadmap & Backlog Focus](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/FMT-exocortex-template/issues/147)** (pinned) — it lists active focus areas grouped by category. Your bug may already be tracked.
2. **Search closed issues** for prior analyses:
   ```
   is:closed your-keyword                    # full-text closed
   is:closed label:stale-archive             # archived during 2026-06-01 cleanup
   is:closed label:triaged-2026-06-01        # all triaged issues (incl. closed)
   ```
3. **Include in the bug report:** OS, IWE version (`bash update.sh --check`), reproducing command, expected vs actual behavior.

Maintainer responds within 1 week, applies a categorization label, and either schedules a fix or marks as `needs-reproduction` / `needs-discussion`.

### Stale & lifecycle

To keep the backlog actionable, a [stale-bot](.github/workflows/stale.yml) runs daily:

- **`needs-reproduction` without reply for 30 days** → labeled `stale-needs-reproduction` with a reminder comment. After **+14 days** without reply (44d total) → auto-closed. Re-open with reproduction details if still relevant.
- **Any open issue 14+ days without `triaged-*` label** → labeled `stale-unattended` (warn-only, no close). This is a maintainer-side signal: «you missed this one».

**Opt out:** apply `keep-alive` label to any issue where the conversation is active but slow. The bot will skip it.

**Exempt labels (never stale):** `keep-alive`, `critical`, `deadline`, `roadmap`, `pinned`, `triaged-accepted`.

**Notification channel:** if you maintain a fork, you can set `TG_BOT_TOKEN` / `TG_CHAT_ID` (or `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` / `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`) env vars and run `bash scripts/fmt-critical-alert.sh` in your Day Open / Week Close — it'll Telegram you any open `critical` or `deadline` issues. Useful for weekend-P0 detection.

### Share Your Setup

Show how you use IWE in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/FMT-exocortex-template/discussions):
- Custom extensions you've built
- Workflows that work well for your domain
- Integration with other tools

### Submit Pull Requests

We welcome PRs for:
- Bug fixes in `setup.sh`, `update.sh`, and scripts
- Documentation improvements
- New extensions (in `extensions/` or `seed/`)
- Platform compatibility fixes (Linux, WSL)
- Translations

## Architecture: Three Layers

Before contributing, understand how IWE is structured:

| Layer | What | Who edits | Location |
|-------|------|-----------|----------|
| **L1 (Platform)** | Core protocols, skills, hooks, scripts | Maintainers only | Delivered via `update.sh` |
| **L2 (Staging)** | Rules being tested before promotion to L1 | Maintainers | `STAGING.md` |
| **L3 (User)** | Your personal customizations | You | `extensions/`, `params.yaml`, CLAUDE.md §9 |

**Key rule:** User customizations go in `extensions/` and `params.yaml`, never in platform files. This ensures `update.sh` works cleanly.

## Promoting a Practice (keep the guide in sync)

When you promote a stabilized practice (via `script-promote.sh` / `skill-promote.sh`) that
changes the *principled* approach to working with IWE — not just an implementation detail —
flag it so the guide-update pipeline can keep the user-facing guide current:

1. Add a `[guide-impact]` marker to the practice file, **or**
2. Add `[guide-update: S7.SS_N]` to the commit message, pointing at the affected section.

The pipeline does the rest: it surfaces the change at Week Close so the maintainer can decide
whether section 7 ("From Use to Creation") of the universal guide needs an update.

**Boundary — guide vs developer-guide.** Content belongs in the guide only if it passes *both* checks:
it is understandable without knowing specific IWE files/commands, **and** a T3+ reader gets it without
first reading the developer-guide. If either check fails, it belongs in the developer-guide instead.

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before You Start

1. Check existing [Issues](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/FMT-exocortex-template/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/FMT-exocortex-template/pulls) to avoid duplicates
2. For non-trivial changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach
3. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`

### Code Style

- **Shell scripts:** Follow existing style. Use `shellcheck` if available
- **Markdown:** Russian for user-facing docs (with English translations where needed). Technical comments in English are fine
- **Commit messages:** `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:` prefixes. Brief, in English or Russian

### What Makes a Good PR

- **One concern per PR** — don't mix bug fixes with new features
- **Test your changes** — run `bash setup.sh --validate` before submitting
- **Update docs** — if your change affects user-facing behavior, update the relevant docs
- **Respect the layers** — platform changes (L1) require discussion; extension examples (L3) are welcome directly

### Review Process

1. Maintainer reviews within 1 week
2. CI runs `setup.sh --validate` automatically
3. Changes to L1 files require maintainer approval
4. Extensions and docs usually merge faster

### For External Contributors

`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` (the text that auto-fills your PR body) describes
IWE's internal WP-Gate pipeline — that's the maintainer's own daily workflow, not a bar
external PRs are held to. If you're not running that pipeline, delete the auto-filled
text and use this instead:

- **What changed and why** — a sentence or two
- **How you tested it** — ran the relevant script/test, or describe the manual check
- **One concern per PR** — see "What Makes a Good PR" above

Labels [`good first issue`](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/FMT-exocortex-template/labels/good%20first%20issue)
and [`Linux-portability`](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/FMT-exocortex-template/labels/Linux-portability)
mark issues that are scoped for a first PR without needing deep context on the rest of
the platform — the [Linux portability tracking issue](https://github.com/TserenTserenov/FMT-exocortex-template/issues/300)
is a good starting point if you're coming from a non-macOS install.

## Development Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone
gh repo fork TserenTserenov/FMT-exocortex-template --clone
cd FMT-exocortex-template

# Validate the template
bash setup.sh --validate

# Run setup in dry-run mode to test changes
bash setup.sh --dry-run
```

---

## Extension Development

The easiest way to contribute is by creating extensions:

```bash
# Extensions hook into protocol stages
extensions/day-open.before.md    # Runs before Day Open
extensions/day-close.after.md    # Runs after Day Close
extensions/session-open.after.md # Runs after Session Open
```

See [extensions/README.md](extensions/README.md) for the full extension API, naming conventions, and sharing guidelines.
